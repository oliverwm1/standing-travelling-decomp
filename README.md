# standing-travelling-decomp

Introduction
------------

The routines included in this repository implement the spectral decomposition defined in Watt-Meyer and Kushner (JAS, 2015). This decomposition takes in two-dimensional data (typically with time and longitude dimensions), applies a 2D Discrete Fourier Transform, and then further separates the Fourier coefficients into standing and travelling components.
